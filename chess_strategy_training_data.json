Use tactical complexity to induce errors (opponent averages 11.5 cp loss per move)\n3. Avoid opponent's strongest openings and steer toward their weak areas\n4. Maintain time pressure and create unfamiliar positions\n\nThis strategy exploits both positional weaknesses and tactical vulnerabilities while leveraging psychological pressure."
